Binary search is an efficient searching algorithm used to locate a specific element 
in a sorted array or list. It follows a divide-and-conquer approach and repeatedly 
partitions the search space in half, narrowing down the range of possible positions for the target element.

The algorithm starts by comparing the target element with the middle element of the array.
If they are equal, the search is successful, and the index of the target element is returned. 
If the target is smaller than the middle element, the search continues in the lower half of 
the array; otherwise, it continues in the upper half.

The process is repeated by dividing the remaining subarray in half until the target element 
is found or the search space is exhausted. The key idea behind binary search is that it eliminates 
half of the remaining elements at each step, resulting in a time complexity of O(log n), where n is 
the size of the array.

Binary search assumes that the array is sorted in ascending order, as it relies on comparing elements 
and dividing the search space. If the array is not sorted, binary search may produce incorrect results. 
Therefore, it is crucial to ensure the array is sorted before applying the binary search algorithm.

Binary search is a fundamental algorithm used in various applications, including searching in large datasets, 
finding boundaries, and solving optimization problems. Its efficiency makes it especially useful when dealing 
with large or ordered datasets, as it significantly reduces the number of comparisons needed to find the target element.
