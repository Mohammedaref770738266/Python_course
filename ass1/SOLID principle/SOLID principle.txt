The SOLID principles are a set of design principles that aim to make software systems more maintainable, modular, and easier to understand. 
The principles were coined by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) and have become a widely accepted standard in object-oriented programming and software design.

SOLID is an acronym that stands for:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
A class or module should have only one reason to change. It means that a class should have only one responsibility or job. 
This principle promotes high cohesion and helps keep classes focused, making them easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Open/Closed Principle (OCP): 
Software entities (such as classes, modules, or functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification. 
In other words, you should be able to extend the behavior of a system without modifying its existing code. 
This is typically achieved through the use of abstraction, interfaces, and inheritance.

Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):
Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This principle ensures that objects of a superclass can be replaced with objects of 
its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program. It defines a contract between classes and their subclasses, promoting polymorphism and enabling code reuse.

Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): 
Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This principle encourages the creation of 
fine-grained interfaces tailored to specific client needs, instead of having large, monolithic interfaces. 
It helps prevent interface pollution and minimizes the impact of changes on clients.

Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): 
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This principle promotes loose coupling between 
components by ensuring that the high-level modules depend on abstractions (interfaces or abstract classes) rather than concrete implementations. 
It enables flexibility, testability, and easier maintenance.
